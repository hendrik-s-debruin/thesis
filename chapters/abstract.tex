	Generating non-trivial trajectories for Cable Driven Parallel Robots is a
	complicated problem. Care must be taken to avoid collisions with obstacles,
	as well as to avoid self-collisions such as cable-cable and cable-platform
	collisions. A proposed project is to investigate generating and guaranteeing
	the safety of such trajectories. To this end, the current report gives a
	brief overview of trajectory generation techniques, path planning algorithms
	and modelling of Cable Driven Parallel Robots.
