	Generating non-trivial trajectories for Cable-Driven Parallel Robots is a
	complicated problem. Care must be taken to avoid collisions with obstacles,
	as well as to avoid self-collisions such as cable-cable and cable-platform
	collisions. The current report documents a methodology for generating
	collision-free paths and trajectories in $\specialEuclideanGroup{3}$ for
	Cable-Driven Parallel Robots in the presence of such obstacles. B-spline
	curves are employed to ensure smoothness in both the found path and the
	motion law along the path.
