\chapter{Overview}%
\label{chap:overview}

	The goal of this thesis is to develop a path planning and trajectory
	generation architecture for \glspl{cdpr}. A randomised sampling algorithm
	based on the \gls{rrt} algorithm is developed
	\cite{bib:planning:rapidly-exploring_random_trees_a_new_tool_for_path_planning}.

	This thesis makes a distinction between a path $\pathsym$ of the robot
	$\robot$, and its corresponding trajectory $\traj$. In particular, a path is
	defined as the set $\setofposes$ of all poses $\pose$ in configuration space
	that the robot moves through while going from the initial pose
	$\pose_{\initial}$ to its goal pose $\pose_{\goal}$.

	In contrast, a trajectory is concerned with the way the robot visits each
	pose. That is, the trajectory determines at what time the robot must be at a
	certain position along the trajectory.

	The path and trajectory are subject to a range of constraints as summarised
	in symbolic form in Equation~\ref{eq:constraints}.

	A brief interpretation of the constraints is offered now.

	Constraints~\ref{eq:constraint:start_initial}
	and~\ref{eq:constraint:finish_goal} impose that the path must start at the
	initial pose and finish at the goal pose.
	Constraint~\ref{eq:constraint:trajectory_maps_to_path} requires that the
	function describing the trajectory map to the function describing the path.
	That is, for any $\timenorm \in [0, 1]$, exactly one value for $\timesym$
	can be found such that:

	\begin{equation}
		\traj(\timesym) = \pathsym(\timenorm)
	\end{equation}

	Since \glspl{cdpr} are actuated by cables and not rigid links, they may
	experience vibrations. To mitigate this, an aim of this thesis is to
	generate paths and trajectories that are as smooth as possible.
	Constraint~\ref{eq:constraint:geometric_differentiablity}, requires that the
	degree of geometric differentiability, $\contdeggeombare$ of the path be at
	least larger than some tunable value $\gain_{\contdeggeombare}$. For
	instance, if:

	\begin{equation}
		\gain_{\contdeggeombare} \geq 2
	\end{equation}

	there will be no sharp corners in $\pathsym$. Similarly,
	constraint~\ref{eq:constraint:kinematic_differentiability} requires that the
	trajectory have a degree of differentiability, $\contdegbare$, at least
	equal to a tunable value $\gain_{\contdegbare}$. For instance, requiring
	that:

	\begin{equation}
		\gain_{\contdegbare} \geq 4
	\end{equation}

	will ensure that the trajectory has a smooth velocity, acceleration and jerk
	profile. Choosing $\gain_{\contdeggeombare}$ and $\gain_{\contdegbare}$
	therefore has a direct effect on minimising the vibrations imposed on the
	robot.

	Constraints~\ref{eq:constraint:end_effector_obstacle_collisions}
	through~\ref{eq:constraint:cable_cable_collisions} require that no
	collisions occur at any point in the path. Due to the nature of
	\glspl{cdpr}, different classes of collisions are possible.
	Constraint~\ref{eq:constraint:end_effector_obstacle_collisions} requires
	that the end effector not collide with any obstacle $\obstacle$.
	Constraint~\ref{eq:constraint:cable_obstacle_collisions} requires that no
	cable $\cable$ collide with any obstacle.
	Constraints~\ref{eq:constraint:end_effector_cable_collisions}
	and~\ref{eq:constraint:cable_cable_collisions} require that the cables not
	collide with the end effector or with each other, respectively.

	Cables can only operate in tension, captured by
	Constraint~\ref{eq:constraint:positive_cable_tensions}.

	Constraint~\ref{eq:constraint:kinematic_limits} requires that the requested
	velocities, accelerations and higher derivatives of the cable position
	adhere to the kinematic limits of the actuators.

	Finally, Constraint~\ref{eq:constraint:minimise_distance}
	and~\ref{eq:constraint:capacity_margin} attempt to minimise the distance
	along the path and maximise the capacity margin $\capacitymargin$ along the
	path. These constraints are often in conflict.

	\section{Information Flow in the Architecture}

		A high-level schematic overview of the information flow in the developed
		architecture can be seen in
		Figure~\ref{fig:architecture_information_flow}.

		\begin{figure}[hbt]
			\centering
			\def\svgwidth{\columnwidth}
			\import{res/img/}{architecture_information_flow.pdf_tex}
			\caption{Architecture Information Flow}
			\label{fig:architecture_information_flow}
		\end{figure}

		The architecture is fairly flexible in that it can read the
		configuration of the robot and obstacles from a configuration file. The
		same architecture can therefore be used on multiple \glspl{cdpr} without
		modifying the source code. This configuration is read during the
		initialisation phase.

		Next, the architecture starts looking for a path through sampling. This
		part of the architecture is responsible for finding a path and
		satisfying Constraints~\ref{eq:constraint:start_initial}
		and~\ref{eq:constraint:finish_goal}, as well as the collision
		constraints~\ref{eq:constraint:end_effector_obstacle_collisions}
		through~\ref{eq:constraint:cable_cable_collisions}. Furthermore, it
		assures that cable tensions remain within bounds
		(Constraint~\ref{eq:constraint:positive_cable_tensions}).

		The post-processing step attempts to make the path smooth to adhere to
		Constraint~\ref{eq:constraint:geometric_differentiablity}. It also tries
		to adapt to the path to simultaneously try and satisfy
		Constraints~\ref{eq:constraint:minimise_distance}
		and~\ref{eq:constraint:capacity_margin}.

		Finally, the architecture builds a trajectory along the path
		(Constraint~\ref{eq:constraint:trajectory_maps_to_path}) subject to the
		smoothness Constraint~\ref{eq:constraint:kinematic_differentiability}
		and kinematic Constraints~\ref{eq:constraint:kinematic_limits}.

	\section{Structure of the Thesis}

		The thesis starts with a literature study in
		Chapter~\ref{chap:literature_study}. The literature study covers
		trajectory generation, path planning and modelling of \glspl{cdpr}.  A
		discussion on how collisions are detected is presented in
		Chapter~\ref{chap:collision_detection}. Chapter~\ref{chap:sampling}
		focusses on the algorithms used to find a collision-free path, while
		Chapter~\ref{chap:path_processing} discusses various post-processing
		steps that are performed to improve the quality of the path.
		Chapter~\ref{chap:motion_law} discusses how a trajectory along the found
		path is generated. A brief overview of the code is given in
		Chapter~\ref{chap:architecture_developed}.
		% Finally,
		% Chapter~\ref{chap:experimental_results} discusses some experimental
		% results.

	\section{Conventions Used in the Thesis}

		A brief note is given here on the conventions used in this thesis.

		\subsection{Coordinate System}

			The usual right-hand coordinate frame is used in this thesis.
			However, note that the $y$-axis was chosen to point upwards. This
			was done to coincide with the conventions used in some of the
			software libraries used during the development of the thesis.
