\section{Ensuring a Smooth Start}%
\label{sec:ensuring_a_smooth_start}

	Consider again Figure~\ref{fig:augmented_motion_law_control_points}. The
	algorithm as presented in Section~\ref{sec:motion_law_generation_algorithm}
	will have a tendency to produce infinite accelerations at $\timesym = 0$.
	This is due to the fact that the slope of the B-spline-interpolated motion
	law at $\timesym = 0$ is non-zero and thus represents a loss of
	differentiability analogous to the loss of differentiability in the
	piecewise linear motion law illustrated in the left half of
	Figure~\ref{fig:motion_law_spline}.

	To combat this effect, an acceleration phase may be introduced into the
	motion law. The goal of this phase is to prepend a section that smoothly
	interpolates from zero slope to the initial slope of the original motion
	law. This is done by choosing some acceleration period $\Delta\timesym$ and
	changing the control points according to:

	\begin{equation}
		\timesym_{\indexi} \gets \timesym_{\indexi} + \Delta\timesym
			\quad\forall\timesym_{\indexi} \in \mlcontrolpointset \setminus \timesym_0
	\end{equation}

	This can be seen as shifting all but the first control point further into
	time. Now, a new control point $\mlcontrolpoint'$ must be created subject
	to:

	\begin{align}
		\begin{split}
			\mlcontrolpoint'.\timesym &\in (0, \Delta\timesym)\\
			\mlcontrolpoint'.\timenorm &\in (0, \mlcontrolpoint_1.\timenorm)
		\end{split}
	\end{align}

	$\mlcontrolpoint'$ is then inserted into $\mlcontrolpointset$ between
	$\mlcontrolpoint_0 $ and $\mlcontrolpoint_1$. To ensure that the slope
	during the acceleration phase of the motion law contains a near-horizontal
	section of sufficient length, the following values are used in this thesis:

	\begin{align}
		\begin{split}
			\mlcontrolpoint'.\timesym &= 0.9\Delta\timesym\\
			\mlcontrolpoint'.\timenorm &= 0.1\mlcontrolpoint_1.\timenorm
		\end{split}
	\end{align}

	The effect of applying this procedure is shown schematically in
	Figure~\ref{fig:smooth_start_motion_law_construction}. Although this figure
	intends to give only a graphical intuition, it is drawn using B-spline
	curves. As can be seen in the figure, this procedure effectively shifts the
	entire motion law in time and slowly accelerates the motion law from zero
	slope to its initial slope.
