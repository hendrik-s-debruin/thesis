	The sampling algorithm (Algorithm~\ref{alg:sampling_planning_overview})
	exits when it manages to attach the goal pose to the graph
	$\topologicalgraph$. At this point, a Dijkstra-search is performed on
	$\topologicalgraph$ to find an ordered set $\setofposes$ of poses $\pose$
	using the distance function in
	Equation~\ref{eq:distance_measure_capcity_margin} as the cost-to-go
	criterion.

	After this step, a collision-free path $\pathsym$ from the start to the goal
	pose may be found by taking points along the convex hull of subsequent
	points in the set $\setofposes$. The issue now becomes that the convex hull
	between two points is a straight line, which means that different segments
	of $\pathsym$ do not blend smoothly. Furthermore, due to the random nature
	of the sampling algorithm, the set $\setofposes$ may contain superfluous
	poses that will cause $\pathsym$ to be unnecessarily complicated. For this
	reason, several post-processing steps were developed and are discussed in
	the current chapter.
