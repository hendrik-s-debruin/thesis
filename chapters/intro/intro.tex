	\glspl{cdpr} are a class of robot where the end-effector is suspended and
	supported by cables. The cables are connected to spools. Through actuation
	of the spools, the end-effector's pose in space may be
	controlled.\cite{bib:cdpr:cable_driven_parallel_robots_theory_and_application}

	Using cables for end-effector manipulation has some benefits over
	traditional serial and parallel robots. Cables are very lightweight.
	\glspl{cdpr} therefore tend to require smaller motors and are consequently
	inexpensive as compared to similar traditional robots. Furthermore, since
	cables are flexible, \glspl{cdpr} can be designed to be easily portable and
	reconfigurable. Due to their inexpensive and lightweight topology,
	\glspl{cdpr} can be made to cover very vast workspaces and are able to
	obtain very high velocities and
	accelerations.\cite{bib:cdpr:cable_driven_parallel_robots_theory_and_application}

	The added flexibility of this class of robot comes at a cost, however. When
	compared to traditional parallel robots, \glspl{cdpr} have the added
	constraint that all cables need to be in tension. That is, it is not
	possible to have a link push the end-effector as is the case with
	traditional robots. Furthermore, \glspl{cdpr} exhibit further new
	challenges, such as cable sagging and vibration.

	\glspl{cdpr} have seen few practical applications to date. However, due to
	their potential, they have started attracting more interest in the research
	community.

	A common problem in robotics is the generation of trajectories.  When
	generating non-trivial trajectories for \glspl{cdpr}, care must be taken to
	avoid any obstacles in the workspace. This is complicated by the fact that
	the cables which support the robot can span large sections of the workspace.
	Rotational trajectories can also cause cable-cable or cable-platform
	collisions. The current thesis report documents an approach to generating
	collision-free trajectories in $\specialEuclideanGroup{3}$ in the presence
	of obstacles.
