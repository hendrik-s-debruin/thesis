\section{End-Effector-Obstacle Collisions}%
\label{sec:end_effector_obstacle_collisions}

	Collisions between the end-effector and obstacles are detected using the
	well-known
	\gls{sat}~\cite{bib:planning:hierarchical_structure_for_rapid_interference_detection}
	theorem. \gls{sat} is not the fastest collision detection algorithm for two
	convex polyhedra. A superior algorithm may be found
	in~\cite{bib:planning:detecting_intersections_between_convex_polyhedra}.
	However, \gls{sat} is considerably simpler to implement. Furthermore, for
	the planning problems addressed by the current thesis, there are few
	obstacles that are modelled in such a way as to have few faces each. Under
	these conditions, \gls{sat} was found to perform sufficiently fast to not
	cause any bottle-neck in the overall architecture.

	For the sake of completeness, the algorithm is briefly described in
	Algorithm~\ref{alg:sat}. Essentially, it looks for a line that passes
	between the objects without intersecting them. It is sufficient to only test
	the normals of the faces of both objects.
