\section{Capacity Margin}%
\label{sec:capacity_margin}

	In general, the cables of a \gls{cdpr} have upper and lower bounds on their
	tensions. These bounds limit the set of wrenches at the end-effector that
	the cables can support. This set of available wrenches $\setofavwrenches$ is
	also pose-dependent. Furthermore, for a given application, it is possible to
	define a set of required wrenches $\setofreqwrenches$ that the end-effector
	must support. A pose $\pose$ can be considered valid if the set of available
	wrenches contains the set of required wrenches\todo{ref this paragraph}:

	\begin{equation}
		\setofavwrenches \supseteq \setofreqwrenches
		\label{eq:wrench_set_requirement}
	\end{equation}

	The capacity margin $\capacitymargin$ \todo{ref sup's paper} is a scalar
	index that measures the degree to which
	Equation~\ref{eq:wrench_set_requirement} is true. It is defined such that:

	\begin{align}
		\begin{split}
			\capacitymargin \geq 0, \quad \setofavwrenches \supseteq \setofreqwrenches \\
			\capacitymargin < 0, \quad \text{otherwise}
		\end{split}
	\end{align}

	The algorithm for calculating the capacity margin was implemented in C++
	using the hyperplane shifting method described in\todo{ref hyperplane
	shifting paper}. The reader is referred to \todo{ref paper list} for the
	algorithms.

	Although the capacity margin does not test for collisions, it is included in
	the collision-detection module. This is because a pose $\pose$ for which
	$\capacitymargin < 0$ cannot support the required wrenches for the current
	application. This implies that the pose should be considered invalid.
