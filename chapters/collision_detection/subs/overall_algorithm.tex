\section{Overall Collision Detection Algorithm}%
\label{sec:overall_collision_detection_algorithm}

	The collision detection algorithms described in this chapter execute
	quickly. However, since they can potentially be called a few thousand times
	during the initial path search, it is beneficial to organise them in such a
	way that the algorithms that are more likely to detect a collision are
	executed before those that are less likely. This can lead to potential
	speed-ups during the execution  of the code.  The overall meta-algorithm for
	collision detection is reported in
	Algorithm~\ref{alg:overall_collision_detection}.
