	The designed architecture uses a sampling approach for path planning. Path
	planning was first investigated in two dimensions before generalising to the
	spatial case. The sampling algorithm used is a variant
	of the well-known \gls{rrt}
	algorithm~\cite{bib:planning:rapidly-exploring_random_trees_a_new_tool_for_path_planning}.

	\section{Overview of Planning Steps}

		As an initial overview, Figure~\ref{fig:path_planning_in_2d} shows the
		different planning stages for the planar case. The orange shapes
		represent obstacles that must be avoided. The green dot is the start
		pose of the end-effector, and the red dot is its final pose. For
		simplicity, the end-effector is not drawn in these images. The top-left
		image shows the construction of a topological graph representing
		possible collision-free paths of the end-effector. The top-right image
		shows the output of a graph-search to obtain a feasible path after the
		graph has been built. The bottom-left shows the output of several
		post-processing steps that optimise and simplify the found path.
		Finally, the bottom-right image shows the effect of smoothing the
		corners of the simplified path.

		The current chapter discusses the generation of the topological graph
		and subsequent graph search in the top row of
		Figure~\ref{fig:path_planning_in_2d}. Chapter~\ref{chap:path_processing}
		discusses the post-processing phases shown in the bottom row of the
		figure.  Both chapters discuss these procedures for the general case in
		$\specialEuclideanGroup{3}$.
