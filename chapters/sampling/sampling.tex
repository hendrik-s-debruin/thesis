	The designed architecture\todo{wording} uses a sampling approach for path
	planning. Path planning was first investigated in two dimensions before
	generalising to the spatial case.\todo{wording again} The sampling algorithm
	used is a variant of the well-known \gls{rrt} algorithm.

	Due to the topology of the class of \gls{cdpr} considered, the sampling
	algorithm does not need to sample in configuration space, but may instead
	sample poses directly. This is due to the fact that there is a one-to-one
	correlation between end-effector pose and robot configuration.

	The algorithm essentially builds a topological graph $\topologicalgraph$
	whose vertices contain collision-free end-effector poses. The edges of the
	graph represent paths that are free of collision. After $\topologicalgraph$
	is built, a path $\pathsym$ is found that connects the start pose
	$\pose_{\initial}$ to the final pose $\pose_{\final}$ by taking into account
	a custom-defined distance function $\dist(\pose_1, \pose_2)$ between two
	neighbour poses in $\topologicalgraph$. A schematic representation is shown
	in Figure~\ref{fig:path_search}. The details are described in the following
	sections.
