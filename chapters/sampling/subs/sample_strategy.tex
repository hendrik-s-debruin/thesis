\section{Sample Strategy}%
\label{sec:sample_strategy}

	Line~\ref{alg:sampling_planning_overview:sample_pose} of
	Algorithm~\ref{alg:sampling_planning_overview} samples a pose from the
	configuration space of the robot in the following manner:

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item

			A translation vector $\transvec$ is drawn from a normal
			distribution such that:
			\label{item:sample_strategy:translation}

			\begin{enumerate}

				\item

					The median of the distribution is the centre of the
					workspace.

				\item

					The edges of the workspace are three standard deviations
					away from the median.
			\end{enumerate}

		\item

			An angle $\theta$ is drawn from a normal distribution with
			median $\pi/2$ and standard deviation $\pi/6$.

			\label{item:sample_strategy:angle}

		\item

			A quaternion is built from the formula:

			\begin{equation}
				\quaternion = 0\vec{i} + \sin(\theta/2)\vec{j} + 0\vec{k} +
					\cos(\theta/2)
			\end{equation}

			\label{item:sample_strategy:quaternion}

			%This produces a rotation of angle $\theta$ around the $y$
			%axis.\todo{explain that y axis is pointing up}

		\item

			The pose $\pose = (\transvec, \quaternion)$ is returned.

	\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Justification of Sampling Strategy}%
	\label{sec:justification_of_sampling_strategy}

		\glspl{cdpr} are more likely to have a higher capacity margin towards
		the centre of their workspace. This led to the decision to use a normal
		distribution to sample translations as described in
		Item~\ref{item:sample_strategy:translation} above. In doing so, the
		sampling algorithm has a higher probability to choose translations
		closer to the centre of the workspace, thereby increasing the average
		stability of the trajectory found.

		Items~\ref{item:sample_strategy:angle}
		and~\ref{item:sample_strategy:quaternion} in the list above generate a
		rotation $\theta$ around the $y$-axis. The reason that rotations are
		only drawn around the $y$ axis is two-fold. The first reason is that
		experimentation has shown that the architecture performs faster when
		only drawing rotations around a single axis. This is because, by
		removing two rotational axes, the search space is reduced by two
		dimensions. The second reason is that, by only drawing rotations around
		the $y$ axis, the robot is guaranteed to be upright during its
		trajectory. This produces simpler trajectories, as generating completely
		random quaternions would have the robot change its orientation
		unpredictably.

		The mean and standard deviation as defined in
		Item~\ref{item:sample_strategy:angle} are chosen such that 99.7\% of
		the sampled rotations lie within the range $\theta \in [0, \pi]$.
		The effect of using a uniform distribution within this range instead
		of the distribution of Item~\ref{item:sample_strategy:angle} was
		also investigated. This, however, was deemed an inefficient
		approach, as the end-effector was found to have a tendency to
		unnecessarily swing back and forth around the $y$-axis as it
		progressed through its trajectory. By instead biassing the
		end-effector's orientation towards a certain median position, the
		need for a post-processing operation to simplify the orientation's
		progression was significantly reduced.

		Following this approach, given an arbitrary start and end pose, the
		architecture finds a path through several poses in such a way that,
		while moving from the start pose to the first sampled pose, the
		robot is turned upright. Then, while in the middle of its
		trajectory, the robot stays upright. Finally, as the robot
		approaches its final pose, it performs any required arbitrary
		rotations to reach the desired goal pose. This is shown
		schematically in Figure~\ref{fig:pose_sampling}.

	\subsection{Improving the Sampled Capacity Margin}%
	\label{sec:improving_the_sampled_capacity_margin}

		While the sampling strategy in
		Algorithm~\ref{alg:sampling_planning_overview} will find a
		collision-free path, the path may be suboptimal in terms of the capacity
		margin. The capacity margin may be improved as part of a post-processing
		step as explained in Section~\ref{sec:increasing_the_capacity_margin}.
		However, relying on pure post-processing can be expensive. A small
		modification to Algorithm~\ref{alg:sampling_planning_overview} is
		therefore proposed here.

		The idea is to sample poses as before, but then immediately after
		Line~\ref{alg:sampling_planning_overview:sample_pose} in
		Algorithm~\ref{alg:sampling_planning_overview} move them in the
		direction of increasing capacity margin $\capacitymargin$ according to:

		\begin{equation}
			\pose \gets \pose +
				\gain\frac
				{%
					\nabla\capacitymargin
				}
				{%
					\norm
					{%
						\nabla\capacitymargin
					}
				}
			\label{eq:improve_sampled_capacity_margin}
		\end{equation}

		This operation is fairly cheap. Therefore, $\gain$ is kept small and
		Equation~\ref{eq:improve_sampled_capacity_margin} is performed
		repeatedly on the sampled pose $\pose$. This can be seen as taking
		random samples from the configuration space, and then ``sliding'' them
		along the curve defining the direction of increasing capacity margin for
		some predefined distance.

		Due to the shape of the capacity margin polytope, if all samples have a
		favourable capacity margin, then the entire path through these poses
		will also have a good capacity margin.
