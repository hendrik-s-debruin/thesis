\section{Assumptions}

	A brief summary of the assumptions for this paper is given here:

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item \label{assumption:cable_slack}

			There is no slack in the cables. This assumption is satisfied as
			long as there is sufficient tension in the cables.


		\item \label{assumption:convex_polyhedra}

			The end-effector and obstacles are modelled as convex polyhedra.
			This simplifies the collision detection. Non-convex shapes are built
			up out of convex primitives.


		\item \label{assumption:static_capacity_margin}

			The capacity margin is calculated for static poses along the
			trajectory. Dynamic effects are neglected.


	\end{enumerate}
