	This paper describes a Rapid Random Tree approach to path planning for
	Cable-Driven Parallel Robots in $\specialEuclideanGroup{3}$ in the presence
	of obstacles. The approach is capable of avoiding cable-cable collisions,
	cable-end-effector collisions, cable-obstacle collisions as well as
	end-effector-obstacle collisions.  B-spline curves are used to ensure
	smoothness of the found trajectory. The approach locally optimises the
	capacity margin of the trajectory while minimising the amount of actuation
	required.
